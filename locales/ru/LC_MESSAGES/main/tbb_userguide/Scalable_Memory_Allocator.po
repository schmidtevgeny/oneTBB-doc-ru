"Both the debug and release versions of |full_name| consists of two "
"dynamic shared libraries, one with general support and the other with a "
"scalable memory allocator. The latter is distinguished by ``malloc`` in "
"its name. For example, the release versions for Windows\\* OS are "
"``tbb<version>.dll`` and ``tbbmalloc.dll`` respectively. Applications may"
" choose to use only the general library, or only the scalable memory "
"allocator, or both. See the links below for more information on memory "
"allocation."
