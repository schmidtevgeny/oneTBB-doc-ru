msgid "When measuring the performance of parallel programs, it is usually *wall clock* time, not CPU time, that matters. The reason is that better parallelization typically increases aggregate CPU time by employing more CPUs. The goal of parallelizing a program is usually to make it run *faster* in real time."

msgid "The class ``tick_count`` in |full_name| provides a simple interface for measuring wall clock time. A ``tick_count`` value obtained from the static method tick_count::now() represents the current absolute time. Subtracting two ``tick_count`` values yields a relative time in ``tick_count::interval_t``, which you can convert to seconds, as in the following example:"

msgid "Unlike some timing interfaces, ``tick_count`` is guaranteed to be safe to use across threads. It is valid to subtract ``tick_count`` values that were created by different threads. A ``tick_count`` difference can be converted to seconds."

msgid "The resolution of ``tick_count`` corresponds to the highest resolution timing service on the platform that is valid across threads in the same process. Since the CPU timer registers are *not* valid across threads on some platforms, this means that the resolution of tick_count can not be guaranteed to be consistent across platforms."
