msgid "When a graph execution is canceled either because of an unhandled exception or because its task_group_context is canceled explicitly, the graph and its nodes may be left in an indeterminate state. For example, in the code samples shown in :ref:`cancel_a_graph` the input 2 may be left in a buffer. But even beyond remnants in the buffers, there are other optimizations performed during the execution of a flow graph that can leave its nodes and edges in an indeterminate state. If you want to re-execute or restart a graph, you first need to reset the graph:"
