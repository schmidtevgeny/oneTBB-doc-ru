"Conceptually a flow graph is a collection of nodes and edges. Each node "
"belongs to exactly one graph and edges are made only between nodes in the"
" same graph. In the flow graph interface, a graph object represents this "
"collection of nodes and edges, and is used for invoking whole graph "
"operations such as waiting for all tasks related to the graph to "
"complete, resetting the state of all nodes in the graph, and canceling "
"the execution of all nodes in the graph."

"The code below creates a graph object and then waits for all tasks "
"spawned by the graph to complete. The call to ``wait_for_all`` in this "
"example returns immediately since this is a trivial graph with no nodes "
"or edges, and therefore no tasks are spawned."
