"As a convention, to communicate the topology, use only functions "
"flow::make_edge and flow::remove_edge. The runtime library uses node "
"functions, such as sender<T>::register_successor, to create these edges, "
"but those functions should not be called directly. The runtime library "
"calls these node functions directly to implement optimizations on the "
"topology at runtime."
