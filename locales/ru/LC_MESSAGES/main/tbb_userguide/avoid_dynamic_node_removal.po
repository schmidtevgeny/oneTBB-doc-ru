"It is possible to add new nodes and edges and to remove old edges from a "
"flow graph as nodes are actively processing messages in the graph. "
"However, removing nodes is discouraged. Destroying a graph or any of its "
"nodes while there are messages being processed in the graph can lead to "
"premature deletion of memory that will be later touched by tasks in the "
"graph causing program failure. Removal of nodes when the graph is not "
"idle may lead to intermittent failures and hard to find failures, so it "
"should be avoided."
