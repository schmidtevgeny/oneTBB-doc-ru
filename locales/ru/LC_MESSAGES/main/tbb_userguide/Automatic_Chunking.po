"A parallel loop construct incurs overhead cost for every chunk of work "
"that it schedules. |full_name| chooses chunk sizes automatically, "
"depending upon load balancing needs. The heuristic attempts to limit "
"overheads while still providing ample opportunities for load balancing."

"Typically a loop needs to take at least a million clock cycles to make it"
" worth using ``parallel_for``. For example, a loop that takes at least "
"500 microseconds on a 2 GHz processor might benefit from "
"``parallel_for``."

"The default automatic chunking is recommended for most uses. As with most"
" heuristics, however, there are situations where controlling the chunk "
"size more precisely might yield better performance."
