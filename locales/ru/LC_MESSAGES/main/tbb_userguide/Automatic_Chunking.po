msgid "A parallel loop construct incurs overhead cost for every chunk of work that it schedules. |full_name| chooses chunk sizes automatically, depending upon load balancing needs. The heuristic attempts to limit overheads while still providing ample opportunities for load balancing."

msgid "Typically a loop needs to take at least a million clock cycles to make it worth using ``parallel_for``. For example, a loop that takes at least 500 microseconds on a 2 GHz processor might benefit from ``parallel_for``."

msgid "The default automatic chunking is recommended for most uses. As with most heuristics, however, there are situations where controlling the chunk size more precisely might yield better performance."
