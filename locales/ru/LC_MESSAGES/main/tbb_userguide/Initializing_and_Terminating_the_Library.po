msgid "oneTBB supports an explicit library termination as a preview feature. The ``oneapi::tbb::finalize`` function called with an instance of class ``oneapi::tbb::task_scheduler_handle`` blocks the calling thread until all worker threads implicitly created by the library have completed. If waiting for thread completion is not safe, e.g. may result in a deadlock or called inside a task, a parallel algorithm, or a flow graph node, the method fails."

msgid "If you know how many active ``oneapi::tbb::task_scheduler_handle`` instances exist in the program, it is recommended to call ``oneapi::tbb::release`` function on all but the last one, then call ``oneapi::tbb::finalize`` for the last instance."
