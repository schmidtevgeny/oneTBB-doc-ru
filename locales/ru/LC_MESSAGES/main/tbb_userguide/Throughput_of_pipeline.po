"The throughput of a pipeline is the rate at which tokens flow through it,"
" and is limited by two constraints. First, if a pipeline is run with "
"``N`` tokens, then obviously there cannot be more than ``N`` operations "
"running in parallel. Selecting the right value of ``N`` may involve some "
"experimentation. Too low a value limits parallelism; too high a value may"
" demand too many resources (for example, more buffers). Second, the "
"throughput of a pipeline is limited by the throughput of the slowest "
"sequential filter. This is true even for a pipeline with no parallel "
"filters. No matter how fast the other filters are, the slowest sequential"
" filter is the bottleneck. So in general you should try to keep the "
"sequential filters fast, and when possible, shift work to the parallel "
"filters."

"The text processing example has relatively poor speedup, because the "
"serial filters are limited by the I/O speed of the system. Indeed, even "
"with files that are on a local disk, you are unlikely to see a speedup "
"much more than 2. To really benefit from a pipeline, the parallel filters"
" need to be doing some heavy lifting compared to the serial filters."

"The window size, or sub-problem size for each token, can also limit "
"throughput. Making windows too small may cause overheads to dominate the "
"useful work. Making windows too large may cause them to spill out of "
"cache. A good guideline is to try for a large window size that still fits"
" in cache. You may have to experiment a bit to find a good window size."
