msgid "The edges in a flow graph make explicit the dependence relationships that you want the library to enforce. Similarly, the concurrency limits on ``function_node`` and ``multifunction_node`` objects limit the maximum number of concurrent invocations that the runtime library will allow. These are the limits that are enforced by the library; the library does not automatically protect you from data races. You must explicitly prevent data races by using these mechanisms."

msgid "If you run the above example, it will likely calculate a global sum that is a bit smaller than the expected solution due to the data race. The data race could be avoided in this simple example by changing the allowed concurrency in ``f`` from unlimited to 1, forcing each value to be processed sequentially by ``f``. You may also note that the ``input_node`` also updates a global value, ``src_count``. However, since an ``input_node`` always executes serially, there is no race possible."
