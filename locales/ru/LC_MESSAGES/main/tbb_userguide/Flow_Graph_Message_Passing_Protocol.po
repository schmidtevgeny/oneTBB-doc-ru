"|full_name| flow graph operates by passing messages between nodes. A node"
" may not be able to receive and process a message from its predecessor. "
"For a graph to operate most-efficiently, if this occurs the state of the "
"edge between the nodes can change its state to pull so when the successor"
" is able to handle a message it can query its predecessor to see if a "
"message is available. If the edge did not reverse from push to pull, the "
"predecessor node would have to repeatedly attempt to forward its message "
"until the successor accepts it. This would consume resources needlessly."

"Once the edge is in pull mode, when the successor is not busy, it will "
