"The examples so far have used the class ``blocked_range<T>`` to specify "
"ranges. This class is useful in many situations, but it does not fit "
"every situation. You can use |full_name| to define your own iteration "
"space objects. The object must specify how it can be split into subspaces"
" by providing a basic splitting constructor, an optional proportional "
"splitting constructor (accompanied with a trait value that enables its "
"usage), and two predicate methods. If your class is called ``R``, the "
"methods and constructors should be as follows:"

"The second argument is not used; it serves only to distinguish the "

"Unlike the basic splitting constructor, the proportional splitting "
"constructor is optional and takes the second argument of type "
"``oneapi::tbb::proportional_split``. The type has methods ``left`` and "
"``right`` that return the values of the proportion. These values should "
"be used to split ``r`` accordingly, so that the updated ``r`` corresponds"
" to the left part of the proportion, and the constructed object "
"corresponds to the right part. The proportional splitting constructor "
"will be used only if the static constant ``is_splittable_in_proportion`` "
"is defined in the class and assigned the value of ``true``."

"Both splitting constructors should guarantee that the updated ``r`` part "

"The iteration space does not have to be linear. Look at "
"``oneapi/tbb/blocked_range2d.h`` for an example of a range that is two-"
"dimensional. Its splitting constructor attempts to split the range along "
"its longest axis. When used with ``parallel_for``, it causes the loop to "
"be \"recursively blocked\" in a way that improves cache usage. This nice "
"cache behavior means that using ``parallel_for`` over a "
"``blocked_range2d<T>`` can make a loop run faster than the sequential "
"equivalent, even on a single processor."
