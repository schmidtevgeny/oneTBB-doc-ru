"Queues are widely used in parallel programs to buffer consumers from "
"producers. Before using an explicit queue, however, consider using "
"``parallel_for_each`` ``parallel_pipeline`` instead. These is often more "
"efficient than queues for the following reasons:"

"A queue is inherently a bottle neck, because it must maintain first-in "
"first-out order."

"A thread that is popping a value may have to wait idly until the value is"

msgid ""
"A queue is a passive data structure. If a thread pushes a value, it could"
" take time until it pops the value, and in the meantime the value (and "
"whatever it references) becomes \"cold\" in cache. Or worse yet, another "
"thread pops the value, and the value (and whatever it references) must be"
" moved to the other processor."

"In contrast, ``parallel_pipeline`` avoids these bottlenecks. Because its "
"threading is implicit, it optimizes use of worker threads so that they do"
" other work until a value shows up. It also tries to keep items hot in "
"cache."
