"The high-level loop and pipeline templates in |full_name| give you "
"efficient scalable ways to exploit the power of multi-core chips without "
"having to start from scratch. They let you design your software at a high"
" task-pattern level and not worry about low-level manipulation of "
"threads. Because they are generic, you can customize them to your "
"specific needs. Have fun using these templates to unlock the power of "
"multi-core."
