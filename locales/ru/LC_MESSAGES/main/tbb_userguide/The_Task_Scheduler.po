"This section introduces the |full_name| *task scheduler*. The task "
"scheduler is the engine that powers the loop templates. When practical, "
"use the loop templates instead of the task scheduler, because the "
"templates hide the complexity of the scheduler. However, if you have an "
"algorithm that does not naturally map onto one of the high-level "
"templates, use the task scheduler."
