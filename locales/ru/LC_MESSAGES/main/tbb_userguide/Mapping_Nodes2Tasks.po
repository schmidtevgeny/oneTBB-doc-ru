"The following figure shows the timeline for one possible execution of the"
" two node graph example in the previous section. The bodies of n and m "
"will be referred to as λ\\ :sub:`n` and λ\\ :sub:`m`, respectively. The "
"three calls to try_put spawn three tasks; each one applies the lambda "
"expression, λ\\ :sub:`n`, on one of the three input messages. Because n "
"has unlimited concurrency, these tasks can execute concurrently if there "
"are enough threads available. The call to ``g.wait_for_all()`` blocks "
"until there are no tasks executing in the graph. As with other "
"``wait_for_all`` functions in oneTBB, the thread that calls "
"``wait_for_all`` is not spinning idly during this time, but instead can "
"join in executing other tasks from the work pool."

"As each task from n finishes, it puts its output to m, since m is a "
"successor of n. Unlike node n, m has been constructed with a concurrency "
"limit of 1 and therefore does not spawn all tasks immediately. Instead, "
"it sequentially spawns tasks to execute its body, λ\\ :sub:`m`, on the "
"messages in the order that they arrive. When all tasks are complete, the "
"call to ``wait_for_all`` returns."

"All execution in the flow graph happens asynchronously. The calls to "
"try_put return control to the calling thread quickly, after either "
"immediately spawning a task or buffering the message being passed. "
"Likewise, the body tasks execute the lambda expressions and then put the "
"result to any successor nodes. Only the call to ``wait_for_all`` blocks, "
"as it should, and even in this case the calling thread may be used to "
"execute tasks from the oneTBB work pool while it is waiting."

"The above timeline shows the sequence when there are enough threads to "
"execute all of the tasks that can be executed in parallel. If there are "
"fewer threads, some spawned tasks will need to wait until a thread is "
"available to execute them."
