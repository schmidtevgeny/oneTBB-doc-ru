msgid "the ``scalable_allocation_mode`` function allows an application to set certain parameters for the memory allocator, such as an option to map memory in huge pages or define a recommended heap size. These settings take effect until modified by another call to ``scalable_allocation_mode``."

msgid "Some of the memory allocator parameters can also be set via system environment variables. It can be useful to adjust the behavior without modifying application source code, to ensure that a setting takes effect as early as possible, or to avoid explicit dependency on the oneTBB allocator binaries. The following environment variables are recognized:"
