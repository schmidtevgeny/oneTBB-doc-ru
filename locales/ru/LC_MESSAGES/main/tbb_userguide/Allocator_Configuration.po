"The oneTBB memory allocator provides the following API functions and "
"environment variables to configure its behavior:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../oneTBB/doc/main/tbb_userguide/Allocator_Configuration.rst:11
msgid ""
"the ``scalable_allocation_command`` function instructs the allocator to "
"perform a certain action, such as cleaning up its internal memory "
"buffers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../oneTBB/doc/main/tbb_userguide/Allocator_Configuration.rst:16
msgid ""
"the ``scalable_allocation_mode`` function allows an application to set "
"certain parameters for the memory allocator, such as an option to map "
"memory in huge pages or define a recommended heap size. These settings "
"take effect until modified by another call to "
"``scalable_allocation_mode``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../oneTBB/doc/main/tbb_userguide/Allocator_Configuration.rst:23
msgid ""
"Some of the memory allocator parameters can also be set via system "
"environment variables. It can be useful to adjust the behavior without "
"modifying application source code, to ensure that a setting takes effect "
"as early as possible, or to avoid explicit dependency on the oneTBB "
"allocator binaries. The following environment variables are recognized:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"``TBB_MALLOC_USE_HUGE_PAGES`` controls usage of huge pages for memory "
"mapping."
msgstr ""

#: ../../oneTBB/doc/main/tbb_userguide/Allocator_Configuration.rst:34
msgid ""
"``TBB_MALLOC_SET_HUGE_OBJECT_THRESHOLD`` defines the lower bound for the "
"size (bytes), that is interpreted as huge and not released during regular"
" cleanup operations."
msgstr ""

#: ../../oneTBB/doc/main/tbb_userguide/Allocator_Configuration.rst:39
msgid ""
"These variables only take effect at the time the memory manager is "
"initialized; later environment changes are ignored. A call to "
"``scalable_allocation_mode`` overrides the effect of the corresponding "
"environment variable."
