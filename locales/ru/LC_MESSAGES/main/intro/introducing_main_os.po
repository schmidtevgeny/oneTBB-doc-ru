"|full_name| is a library that supports scalable parallel programming "
"using standard ISO C++ code. It does not require special languages or "
"compilers. It is designed to promote scalable data parallel programming. "
"Additionally, it fully supports nested parallelism, so you can build "
"larger parallel components from smaller parallel components. To use the "
"library, you specify tasks, not threads, and let the library map tasks "
"onto threads in an efficient manner."

"Many of the library interfaces employ generic programming, in which "
"interfaces are defined by requirements on types and not specific types. "
"The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is an example of generic "
"programming. Generic programming enables oneTBB to be flexible yet "
"efficient. The generic interfaces enable you to customize components to "
"your specific needs."

"The net result is that oneTBB enables you to specify parallelism far more"
" conveniently than using raw threads, and at the same time can improve "
"performance."
